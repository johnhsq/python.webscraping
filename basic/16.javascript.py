# This page contains some sample text, hardcoded into the pageâ€™s HTML, that is replaced by Ajax-generated content after a two-second delay. 


### The WebDriver object is a bit like a browser in that it can load websites, 
# but it can also be used like a BeautifulSoup object to find page elements, 
# interact with elements on the page (send text, click, etc.), and do other actions to drive the web scrapers.

### before run this code, download ChromeDriver based on your Chrome Version
# http://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads
# and store it in your local folder: $ mkdir -p ./drivers/
# $ cd ./drivers 
# $ xattr -d com.apple.quarantine chromedriver # enable security and privacy compliance to Mac
